## Ballerina Unit Tests

The Repo shows code examples for writing and running Ballerina Language unit tests.

### Testing In Ballerina

There are several language principals and capabilities built into Ballerina Language which support testing.  They include the following:

 - Ballerina programmers can either place their test code into a single source code file or in a tests folder inside a project directory structure

 - Ballerina tests are defined using a set of annotations

 - Test assertions can be used to verify the set of program behaviour expectations

 - Data providers can be used to feed in the test data sets

 - Service calls can be tested using service skeletons in the test phase of the project until the system is connected to real service
 
 - Function mocks can be used to mimic third party function calls to enable testing a project package in isolation
